Absolute response time: Is the total time from the instance a user clicks on a link until the response from the server is rendered completely.
Perceived response time: Response time as perceived by the user.
Rendering time: Time taken by the browser to parse and render the response received from the server.
Network latency: Time taken by a data packet to be captured, transmitted, and processed through multiple devices, then recieved at its destination.
Typically, anything at 100ms is acceptable for gaming. However, the 20ms to 40ms range is considered optimal.

Throughput: Number os transactions per unit time, measured in transactions/second or bandwidth(bytes/second).
Utilization: Ratio of throughput to maximum capacity. It is not desirable to operate above 80% utilization.
Robustness: How well the application detects and handles various errores and exceptions (we use MTBF to measure robustness).

Performance test enviroment: Hardware and Software used to conduct performance testing.
Not advisable to be done in the production enviroment.

Why we need a seperate test enviroment?
The system might crash.
the app response time might be degraded.
The possibility of creating security holes.
The database might include the tests input and output information.
app log files and system log files may be filled up.
Analytics might be influenced.

Performance ENVIROMENT should be like the production enviroment.
