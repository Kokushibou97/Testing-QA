For launching an application that could be used by users. Real users.
How to ensure that real users won't have problems while using the app? Performance testing.

Formal definition? Is time behavior (response to inputs), resource using (memory), the capacity of the system. All fo those are the features that performance testing
is focusing on.

              Types:
                    1.Load testing.
                    2.Stress testing.
                    3.Spike testing.
                    4.Scalability testing.
                    5.Endurance testing.
                    6.Concurrrency testing.
                    7.Capacity testing.


Load generation: approaches of load generation is suitable when there is frequent changes in the UI? APIs
 approaches of load generation is suitable when we need to represent a small number of users? Users interface.
 approaches of load generation is suitable when we need to simulate very large numbers of users in a repeatable and reliable manner? Communication protocols.
