Is a software that is used by Agile teams. 
Why Jira for testers? To report defects; static testing; Acceptance criteria; Verify requirements.

We have three types of projects:
                                1.Kanban.
                                2.SCRUM.
                                3.Bug/defect tracking.
The word “issue” in Jira means anything that we will work on.
