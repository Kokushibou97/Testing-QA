What are the component of a web page? CSS and HTML.

Locators:
ID: is one of the important locator for Selenium to find elements. The next code can be used: driver.findelement(By.id("Value"));
    Not all elements have IDs. The ID might be auto-generated 
NAME: is also one of the important locator for Selenium to find elements. The following code can be used: driver. findelement(By.name("Value"));
     If some elements might have neither ID nor NAME, we can use other locators.
for example: Class Name locator   We can use the following code:  driver. findelement(By.Class("from-control"));
             We use this in case ID and NAME are located inside a class.
             The compound classes are not allowed in class name locator
Link text locator:  driver. findelement(By.linktext("Value"));
