In testing reports we have the testing progress reports and the test summary reports.
In case of feedback for example, the defect reports are the most ideal to inform about the overall quality of our product/service.So, we need a document that summerizes every detail.

Types of test reports:
                     1. Progress test report: A test type that is produced at regular intervals about the progress of test activities against a baseline, risks, and alternative
                                              requering a decision, Other names: test status report. Ex: each week we give a feedback via report.
                    2. Summary test report: This type is produced at complition milestones that provides an evaluation of the corresponding test items against exit criteria.
                                            ex: unite testing. if we finish we produce a summary report.

Testers have a default template.:
                                Title -> steps -> testing results -> actual results.
                                Expected results -> actual results -> severity ->priority -> a screeshot or a video.

However, in the testing report there is no unifide template (it depends on the stakeholders and the audiance). 
In case of doubt, ask the audiance (what are the importanturgent information that they would like to know). Essencial information in the most easy/ consuming less time report.

 best work product to be given to the client as feedback on the quality of the product? The progress report.

If we are using exploratory testing, we will not write test cases in the test summary report.
