Or achetictural or the structure testing of the system.
(Unit testing)

Team cross functunality: The team measure their functons.
In the case of this type of testing, the tester should be experienced with the code the system is wrote in.

cover all the statements inside your code to get 100% statement coverage. How to achieve statement coverage?
nº of statement cases/total nº of statements.
The statement Coverage technique is not the best technique to be used on your code in White-Box testing.


Técnicas:
Decision coverage: Or branch coverage Is to test all decisions outcomes in the code to be tested. (Decision -> yes/no -> results) (if/else)
Condition coverage: more detailed testing. In this type we test each condition in the code in true or false guess.
Path coverage: The goal is to test all possible paths in the code.
Modified condition decision coverage: A mix of the two types where we mix for safety, like planes systems.
Loop coverage: focuses on testing the functionality of loops within a program.
